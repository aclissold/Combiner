Combiner
========

Combiner takes a collection of sprites and combines them into a spritesheet.

More specifically, run this program in a directory containing 0.jpg, 1.jpg, ...,
n.jpg, where i.jpg is a 32x32 .jpg image. Then, combiner.go will prompt for the
number of files (n+1 in this example) and the number of sprites per row, and
will output them to spritesheet.png.
