Combiner
========

Combiner takes a collection of sprites and combines them into a spritesheet.

More specifically, pass this program the name of a directory containing 0.jpg,
1.jpg, ..., n.jpg, where i.jpg is a 32x32 .jpg image. Then, combiner.go will
prompt for the number of sprites per row and output them to spritesheet.png.
